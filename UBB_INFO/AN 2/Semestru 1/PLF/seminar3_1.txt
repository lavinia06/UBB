%A list of numbers and sublists of numbers is given.Substitute each sublist in which the sum of the elements is odd with the first element of that sublist
%(we assume sublists are not empty).Example: [1,2,[2,4],7,3,[4,6,7],[1],8,10,[3,2]] 
% => [1,2, [2,4] ,7,3,4,1,8,10,3]

sum([], 0).
sum([H|T], S):-
    sum(T, S1),
    S is S1+H.

f([], []).
f([[H1|T1]|T], [H1|R]):-
    sum([H1|T1], S),
    S mod 2 =:= 1,
    f(T, R).
f([H|T], [H|R]):-
    f(T, R).
