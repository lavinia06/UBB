    <h4>Short description</h4>
    <p>
      Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell is an American singer and songwriter.
      She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single "Ocean Eyes", which was subsequently released by Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records.
      The song was written and produced by her brother, Finneas O'Connell, with whom she frequently collaborates on music and in live shows.
      Her debut extended play, Don't Smile at Me (2017), was commercially successful, charting within the top 15 in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia. <br>
      Eilish's first studio album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019), debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and reached number one in the UK. It was one of the best-selling albums of 2019, buoyed by the success of its fifth single, "Bad Guy", Eilish's first number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2020, she co-wrote and performed the theme song "No Time to Die" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK singles chart and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Her next singles "Everything I Wanted", "My Future", "Therefore I Am", and "Your Power" each peaked within the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second album, Happier Than Ever (2021), reached number one in 25 countries. <br>
      Eilish has received several accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, one Guinness World Record, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history and second overall to win all four general field categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year. She was featured in Time<b>[1]</b> magazine's inaugural Time 100 Next list in 2019, and the main Time 100 list in 2021. According to the RIAA and Billboard, Eilish is the 26th-highest-certified digital singles artist and one of the most successful artists of the 2010s.
